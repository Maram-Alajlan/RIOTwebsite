				<h3>Objectives</h3>

				<p>
					After the success of the <a
						herf="http://www.springer.com/gp/book/9783319260525">Springer
						Book on ROS (Volume 1)</a> with 27 chapters, and <a
						href="http://www.springer.com/gp/book/9783319549262">Springer
						Book on ROS (Volume 2)</a> with 19 chapters, this is a third call for
					chapters for a Springer book on Robot Operating System (ROS). The
					objective of the third volume is to provide the reader with
					comprehensive references on the Robot Operating System (ROS), which
					is currently considered as the main development framework for
					robotics applications.
				<p>ROS (Robot Operating System) has been developed by Willow
					Garage and Stanford University as a part of STAIR project as a free
					and open-source robotic middleware for the large-scale development
					of complex robotic systems. ROS acts as a meta-operating system for
					robots as it provides hardware abstraction, low-level device
					control, inter-processes message-passing and package management. It
					also provides tools and libraries for obtaining, building, writing,
					and running code across multiple computers.
				<p>The main advantage of ROS is that it allows manipulating
					sensor data of the robot as a labeled abstract data stream, called
					topic, without having to deal with hardware drivers. This book
					intends to fill the gap and to provide ROS users (academia and
					industry) with a comprehensive coverage on Robot Operating System
					concepts and applications. It will cover several topics ranging
					from basics and foundation to advanced research papers. Tutorial,
					survey and original research papers will be sought. The book will
					cover several areas related to robot development using ROS
					including but not limited to robot navigation, UAVs, arm
					manipulation, multi-robot communication protocols, Web and mobile
					interfaces using ROS, integration of new robotic platform to ROS,
					computer vision applications, development of service robots using
					ROS, development of new libraries and packages for ROS, using ROS
					in education, etc. Every book chapter should be accompanied with a
					working code to be put later in a common repository for the
					readers.

				System (ROS) is of interest for the book. The topics of interest
				include – but not limited to- the following:
				<ul>
					<li>ROS 2.0 Tutorials</li>
					<li>ROS Basics and Foundations</li>
					<li>Robot Control and Navigation</li>
					<li>Self-driving cars using ROS</li>
					<li>Arm Manipulation</li>

				<h3>Chapters Categories</h3>
				The book will accept three categories of chapters:
				<ul>
					<li><b>Tutorial chapter:</b> it focuses on a particular ROS
						concept or contributed package and provides a step-by-step
						tutorial that explains the fundamental of the concepts/packages
						and presents detailed guidelines on how to use the contributed
						code. It must specify the ROS versions that are compatible with
						the tutorial code, and must provide illustration with figures and
						code interpretations. The code must be available to public in a
						share repository (to be announced later). Accompanying Video
						tutorials are highly recommended.</li>
					<li><b>Research chapter:</b> it presents a research technical
						contribution in the robotics area where ROS was used to validate
						the findings. The chapter must presents a sufficient material on
						the technical contribution in addition to necessary theoretical
						background, but a major focus should be made to ROS implementation
						and experimentation. The implementation and experimentation must
						be sufficiently detailed for a reader be able to reproduce the
						experiments. It must specify the ROS versions that are compatible
						with the tutorial code, and must provide illustration with figures
						and code interpretations. The code must be available to public in
						a share repository (to be announced later). Accompanying Video
						tutorials are highly recommended.</li>
					<li><b>Case study chapter:</b> a case study chapter should
						present a real-world experimentation with ROS on particular
						robotics platform. It should present a detailed description of
						observations made during experiments, and what are the challenges
						encountered during development and experimentation. The chapter
						should also highlight the best practices that would facilitate
						deployment and the lessons learnt.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>This volume welcome chapters about the upcoming version ROS
					2.0, including tutorials, comparisong with ROS 1.0, new features in
					ROS 2.0. Also, hot topics papers related to using ROS for umanned
					aerial vehicles and self-driving cars are particularly welcome.
